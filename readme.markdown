Introduction

### What

EuropaPHP is an extremely fast, flexible and lightweight MVC Framework designed for PHP 5.3+.

### Where

http://europaphp.org

### When

### Why

You're a software engineer/architect that needs a solid, scalable backbone to drive your MVC layer that follows widely accepted standards. You also want the flexibility to drop in the Zend Framework (or any other library for that matter) as they are a perfect pair for each other.
