EuropaPHP
=========

EuropaPHP is an extremely fast, flexible and lightweight <del>M</del>VC Framework designed for PHP 5.4+.

Why Another PHP Framework?
--------------------------

EuropaPHP is the manifestation of the shortcomings of other PHP frameworks with a strong focus on scalability, standards, the view/controller relationship and dependency injection. It is specifically designed to be paired with your favourite libraries and it will seamlessly integrate with anything.

Installation
------------

Extract it anywhere you want as long as you can view the `www/index.php` in a browser. The `index.php` file can be located anywhere as long as you update the `require` statement in it.

So How Do You Use it?
---------------------

To check out the documentation, just go into the `lib` directory. Each directory has a `readme` that corresponds to it. To update the documentation, just do as you'd normally do with code.
