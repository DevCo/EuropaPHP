== 1.2.0 ==

1. Move to PHP 5.3.0 compliance. Rename all _Abstract classes to a more approproate name and implement namespaces.

== 1.1.0 ==

1. Completely re-work architecture. Europa can now be configured - where necessary - by passing arguments, an array of options or by extending and overriding certain methods instead of using Europa_Base as in 1.0.2.

2. Create an extensible routing system with Europa_Request_Route_Abstract.

3. Include an default routing algorithm based on regular expressions called Europa_Request_Route_Regex.

4. Add Europa_String class for fluid string manipulation and internal inflection.

5. Include an optional Europa_Controller_Abstract class to setup defaults in controllers.

6. Europa_View_Abstract was created to fascilitate extensible view creation.

7. Renamed Europa_Controller to a more appropriate Europa_Request.

8. Added methods to Europa_Request for retrieving information about the request.

9. Added Europa_Request::getAcceptedContentTypes() for parsing out the Accept request header when RESTfully handling requests.

10. Exceptions are now explicitly thrown wherever an error may occur. Bootstrapping code should be appropriately wrapped in try/catch blocks.



== 1.0.2 ==

1. Fix bug where exceptions wouldn't be printed out on PHP <= 5.2.0 because  die() wouldn't invoke the magic __toString() method. Changed to echo while exiting after it (you don't really have to exit, it's just an anal precaution).

2. Remove instance auto-saving from Europa_Base. Eliminates second argument to Europa_Base::__construct.

3. Provide a setInstance method to save the instance to the object using an instance name.

4. Remove ability to auto-instantiate a new instance with Europa_Base::getInstance. It now only retrieves a named instance that has been set using Europa_Base::setInstance.

5. Implement spl_autoload and fallback to __autoload if the Standard PHP Library doesn't exist.

6. Remove Europa_Loader::registerAutoload(). Autoload registering now occurs at the top of Europa/Controller.php.



== 1.0.1 ==

1. Fix bug in Europa_Loader::loadClass() on BSD/Mac systems where PHP would return the path to a file using realpath() even if the file didn't exist.

2. Add static method Europa_Controller::getActiveInstance() and Europa_Controller::getDispatchStack().

3. Fix bug where force routing (via route property or passing an argument to dispatch) wasn't working in Europa_Controller.



== 1.0.0 ==

1. Initial release of EuropaPHP.
