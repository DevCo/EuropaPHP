Europa
======

These are the Europa framework files.

When you include `Europa\Fs\Loader`, this directory is automatically registered as an autoload path. Any classes in here following the PHP standard naming convention will be autoloadable. This includes classes with both PHP 5.2 and 5.3 style of namespace separators (both `_` and `\`).

If you are using Europa as a composer package and are using the `autoload.php` file already, you don't have to do anything.
