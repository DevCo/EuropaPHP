Libraries
=========

When you include `Europa\Fs\Loader`, this directory is automatically registered as an autoload path. Any classes in here following the PHP standard naming convention will be autoloadable. This includes classes with both PHP 5.2 and 5.3 style of namespace separators (both `_` and `\`).

Europa
------

The EuropaPHP framework files.

Testes
------

The name aside, it this was a better choice for us than PHP Unit. It is easier to use, smaller and follows more strict standards.
